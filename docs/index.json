Clone Sample Repo You will need to have a little familiarity with git, if not you might want to lookup a git tutorial.\nStart by cloning the base repo and push it to a repo on your own GitHub account. Change the name of myCompany-Workshop :)\ngit clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-modernization-workshop-base myCompany-Workshop  We use clone instead of fork as you will break this from the sample repo and change the name. Once approved and published the repo will be called something to the effect aws-modernization-workshop-with-Company_Name\n 2. Download submodules The repo uses git submodules so cd into the newly cloned repo:\ngit submodule init git submodule update 3. Create and push to YOUR GitHub repo Create a repo in your GitHub account and follow the instructions under \u0026ldquo;Push an existing repository from the commandline\u0026rdquo;\n4. Install Hugo macOS: `brew install hugo` Windows: `choco install hugo -confirm` To make the creation of web page documentation easier, we utilize a tool called Hugo. You will write your documentation/instructions using markdown language and Hugo will create static html content that can be served via S3. Hugo additionally applies a theme so that the site will have an AWS look and feel plus add additional features to beautify and make content stand out.\nFor more information about installing and using Hugo, visit https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/\nFor more information about the learn theme used in Hugo, visit https://learn.netlify.com/en/\n 5. Running Hugo From within the root of the repo\n$ hugo server Using a browser go to http://localhost:1313 to view the site. Hugo is dynamic, so as you edit the content and the page in the browser will change. Allowing you to view in real-time what the content will look like.\n"

What is the use case or problem that your product solves for the end user and develop a story around it. Two things to have in the back of your mind while you think about this: 1. Customers don\u0026rsquo;t buy products they buy solutions to their problems and 2. Make learning fun, have a nice story that can entertain them while educating them at the same time. We have all sat through those boring click and paste workshops, don\u0026rsquo;t make yours one of them.\nBuild new or use an existing workshop? This decision will come down to the story you are trying to tell. If your product or solution is a simple integration to a bigger product or story then you might want to consider building onto an existing workshop. If you have a full story to tell or their is no existing workshop that fits your need then its best to create your own stand alone workshop.\nWorkshops are meant to evolve, so a good story will be extended by other partners, SA\u0026rsquo;s, and the public. The workshop is open source and that how it will grow.\n Examples of some existing workshops  https://snyk.awsworkshop.io/ https://newrelic-serverless.awsworkshop.io https://openshift4-on-aws.awsworkshop.io/ https://eksworkshop.com https://cdkworkshop.com  "

Hugo uses the content stored in content to build web pages. If you look under the directory there is a file _index.md. This is the starting point of the documentation and is the equivalent of index.html. Each folder becomes the high level navigation. Each of the folders and files are prefixed with a number, which is there for visual ordering only and does not have an effect on the actual html or workshop order.\nStart with /content/_index.md Each file has what Hugo calls front matter. This is basically metadata that Hugo uses when generating the files. Here is an example, note the Title and weight fields. Weight controls the ordering, lower number the higher the order. Front matter weight is what actually orders the content in Hugo, prefixing numbers to files such as 1_my_content.md is only for visual ordering in your IDE/directory listing.\n--- title: \u0026#34;Main Page\u0026#34; chapter: true weight: 1 --- Edit The title and the text below the 3 dashes, now Save If everything went well the browser should refresh with the changes you have just make.\nEdit folder names and files The folder names are stubs and should be edited to make clear what type of content is stored in them. The file _index.md within each folder sets the order using the weight front matter, and the name that appears in the left navigation pane. Once again names are prefixed with a number only to visually sort, the weight is what really determines the ordering.\nWhen creating additional sections or pages, copy the files and folders from another section, rename and edit.\n Samples and building blocks In the repo https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-modernization-workshop-sample there are several examples and content that you can copy and reuse in your workshop. * content directory - Various building blocks such as an account and Cloud9 instance. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget the images in static/images * code-samples directory is CloudFormation, CodeBuild, and other samples. The CloudFormation folder is available publicly at https://modernization-workshop-bucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cfn/ so you can leverage existing templates for nesting and one-click deployments.\nFeel free to leverage these samples in your solution. Note this is a workshop so samples are not meant to be best practice, but more for educational purposes only. So if your workshop uses an RDS instance there is no reason to setup replication, backups, and everything else that goes along with making a robust solution, this is of course unless your workshop is on building robust fault tolerant solutions ;)\nScripts, Artifacts, custom CloudFormation templates If your workshop includes custom scripts, artifacts, etc\u0026hellip; you should save them to the content folder where they will be needed. As an example, if I have a getting_started.sh that is used in the First Section, I would place that script in content/10_first_section\nSpecial markdown samples  Markdown cheat sheet https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet Learn theme markdown https://learn.netlify.app/en/cont/markdown/ Menu extras and shortcuts https://learn.netlify.app/en/cont/menushortcuts/ Using Font Awesome Emoji\u0026rsquo;s  https://learn.netlify.app/en/cont/icons/ to help your page pop   "

A workshop format is used because it scales well, meaning you can deliver the content and message whenever and wherever the customer happens to be, whether the customer is at work, home, or at an AWS event they can get hands on and learn about building products and solutions.

	"content": " Additional editing tips  Use Cloud9 for the IDE and workshop host for all participants. Having users setup their local workstations doesn\u0026rsquo;t work very well and often contributes to a poor user experience. Review the flow of other workshops. To create a new page, copy another document and rename it. The name is only important to the builders, but the actual name that shows in the navigation is the title at the top of the document.\n If you want to create a new page between 10 and 20 you can use any number in the name as long as it\u0026rsquo;s sequentially between 10 and 20. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to appropriately set the weight in the top section. Place all images in {repo_root}/static/images. There are several examples of using images in the sample content. Provide users with sample output in \u0026lt;pre\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt; tags so that the copy to clipboard function is not there. No reason to copy example output to the clipboard. DO NOT assume that the user has any exposure to AWS or your product. Everything needs to be explained and all command or areas in the UI you want the user to go to needs to be provided. Screen shots or examples work well for this, especially on busy UI\u0026rsquo;s.\n Use an architecture diagram in your workshop. Show people what are going to deploy. Visuals work wonders when educating people about abstract concepts.\n  "

	"title": "FAQs",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " FAQ\u0026rsquo;s Why do you use Cloud9? A. When conducting workshops it is often difficult to determine the state of the users workstation and validate that all dependencies and requirements are installed. With Cloud9 we get a capable IDE and shell access to the AWS account. Git, aws-cli, programming languages, and many other tools are pre-installed which allows us to start everyone from a known state and not have to fumble around with missing components from someones workstation.\nCan I change the License? A. We rather you not. The site will be posted at aws-samples and the license included in the sample is MIT, which is meant to be simple and open source friendly.\nWhat if I want to use other tools, such as Jenkins or Terraform as examples? A. Great. We actually encourage you to use other tools and services as you may expect customers to use this in their environment. Note that if you choose to use additional or alternative tools that it\u0026rsquo;s easy for the end user to follow and does not detract from your main message. As an example, if your main message is application security scanning, does it make a difference whether you use Jenkins or CodeBuild, or does the usage of one or the other add unnecessary complexity that has nothing to do with your message? So don\u0026rsquo;t reinvent the wheel and if there is already an example of instrumenting testing in CodeBuild, I would use that as the tool has nothing to do with your message. But if your main message is instrumenting security scanning on Jenkins, then yes, use Jenkins.\nHow long does a workshop take to create? A. As little as 3 days and as long as 2 months. If the workshop creator is familiar with git, markdown, and AWS the content can be created in as little as 3 days, which includes testing out the workshop flow. If the user is not familiar with some of these tools, there is a learn curve they will need to overcome. Additionally, dedication also plays a factor. To complete the workshop in 3 days requires full dedication. If someone is splitting time with their \u0026ldquo;day job\u0026rdquo; and workshop creation then it can be expected to take longer.\nWhat skill level are workshop participants? A. The spectrum varies from not familiar to experts. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume workshop participants are familiar with AWS and you should include links to areas of the console you want the user to navigate to.\nHow long should a workshop be?\nA. The typical length of a workshop should be around ~2 hours to complete. We have noticed that if it takes any more time the user will get bored and you may have a problem with drop outs. If your content is longer than 2 hours, consider breaking it up into multiple modules. Tip. If breaking up into multiple modules, create a flow that participants can start up a new module without having to go back through previous modules again. This allows workshop users to take breaks that may span days between modules. This is typically accomplished by automating steps the participant followed in previous modules.\n"
