### What exactly is a workshop? 
<p style="text-align:left;">A workshop is an educational tool used to inform users and end customers
on how to use AWS & partner products and services. What better way to learn than to let customers get hands on with building or instrumenting products or services in an actual AWS environment. A workshop format is used because it scales well, meaning you can deliver the content and message whenever and wherever the customer happens to be, whether the customer is at work, home, or at an AWS event they can get hands on and learn about building products and solutions.
