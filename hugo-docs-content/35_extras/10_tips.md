#### Additional editing tips 

* Use Cloud9 for the IDE and workshop host for all participants.  Having users setup their local workstations doesn't work very well and often contributes to a poor user experience.
* Review the flow of other workshops. 
* To create a new page, copy another document and rename it.  The name is only important to the builders, but the actual name that shows in the navigation is the title at the top of the document.  
* If you want to create a new page between 10 and 20 you can use any number in the name as long as it's sequentially between 10 and 20.  Don't forget to appropriately set the weight in the top section.
* Place all images in {repo_root}/static/images.  There are several examples of using images in the sample content.
* Provide users with sample output in `<pre> </pre>` tags so that the copy to clipboard function is not there.  No reason to copy example output to the clipboard.
* DO NOT assume that the user has any exposure to AWS or your product.  Everything needs to be explained and all command or areas in the UI you want the user to go to needs to be provided.  Screen shots or examples work well for this, especially on busy UI's.  
* Use an architecture diagram in your workshop.  Show people what are going to deploy.  Visuals work wonders when educating people about abstract concepts.
