# Conclusions

Sysdig’s cloud native application protection platform unifies cloud and container security to help AWS users ship applications fast without security becoming a bottleneck. By consolidating the security capabilities needed for vulnerability management, permissions and configuration management, and threat detection and response, you can shift left and shield right –  to identify security problems before they move into production and improve operational practices and security monitoring to defend against attacks.

AWS has revolutionized how modern applications are built and delivered, helping  organizations maintain a competitive edge and meet ever-changing customer demands. As customers expand their use of AWS services and leverage containerized workloads running on Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Fargate, adapting security practices is key to success.

By tapping into key data sources for cloud and containers, including system calls, Kubernetes audit logs, and CloudTrail logs, Sysdig is able to provide real-time visibility to address misconfigurations, unwanted activity, and threats across your cloud infrastructure and workloads. Our security built on open source Falco and the application of Runtime Insights helps drive greater efficiency, helping teams prioritize, focus, and address the most critical risks across AWS cloud infrastructure and workloads.
