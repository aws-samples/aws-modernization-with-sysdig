# Conclusions

The Sysdig Secure Platform is as **a single source of truth** in terms of cloud security posture:

- Detect runtime threats in investigate security incidents, even for serverless workloads in Fargate
- Scan vulnerabilities in all your running workloads and container repositories. You can further strengthen your security and compliance by implementing image scanning in other places of your DevOps lifecycle, like the [CI/CD pipelines](https://sysdig.com/blog/image-scanning-aws-codepipeline-codebuild/) or in the registry.
- Check your compliance status and runtime security events.

AWS security can save your infrastructure from failing at its worst moment. It will protect you and your customer data against misconfigurations, a security compromise, or your wallet from unexpected fees.

CloudTrail is a great source of truth, as it can see everything that is happening in your AWS accounts. Leverage Sysdig Secure by deploying Sysdig CloudConnector for CloudTrail and obtaining the runtime visibility you need to implement AWS threat detection. Its out-of-the-box set of Falco rules for CloudTrail minimizes the setup effort, response time, and resources needed for investigating security events.
