title: "Modifying a Falco Rule for CloudTrail"

Using Sysdig CloudConnector, you are not limited to the out-of-the-box rules provided. You can modify existing rules, or write your own tailored to your own needs.

Letâ€™s try first modifying a rule. The following rule checks if a resource is created in a region that you are not usually using. However, to be active you must specify which regions you want to detect.


```
- list: disallowed_aws_regions
  items: []

- rule: AWS command executed on unused region
  desc: Detect AWS command execution on unused regions
  condition:
    not jevt.value[/errorCode] exists and
    jevt.value[/awsRegion] in (disallowed_aws_regions)
  output:
    An AWS command has been executed on an unused region
    (requesting user=%jevt.value[/userIdentity/arn],
     requesting IP=%jevt.value[/sourceIPAddress],
     AWS region=%jevt.value[/awsRegion]
  priority: CRITICAL
  tags: [cloud, source=cloudtrail, aws]
  source: k8s_audit
```

1. For the *disallowed_aws_regions* empty list that is included, we are going to extend it to include **us-west-1** and **us-west-2**. Let's update that list to add those regions.

```
- list: disallowed_aws_regions
  items: [us-west-1, us-west-2]
  update: true

```

    When you create custom Falco files, ensure last content in the file is a blank new line without extra tabs to avoid messing with additional files that may be loaded after it.

1. To create a `disallowed_aws_regions.yaml` file in a `rules` directory, you can run the following

```
mkdir -p rules
cat <<EOF >>rules/disallowed_aws_regions.yaml
- list: disallowed_aws_regions
  items: [us-west-1, us-west-2]
  update: true

EOF
```

     When you deploy Cloud Connector, it creates a bucket for you to store configuration and custom Falco code. It's name will be autogenerated with "**CloudConnector**" as a prefix. You can work with it using AWS web dashboard, however we are going to explain how to do it using the AWS cli.

1. First let's store the bucket name in a variable called `cc_bucket`

```
cc_bucket=$(aws cloudformation list-stack-resources --stack-name CloudConnector --output json | jq '.StackResourceSummaries[] | select(.LogicalResourceId=="CloudConnectorBucket").PhysicalResourceId' | xargs)
echo $cc_bucket
```

1. Now let's sync our local `rules` directory with the bucket. Execute this command to upload the directory contents, deleting any extra file located in the remote directory.

```
aws s3 sync "./rules/" s3://$cc_bucket/rules --delete
```

1. We now have to restart the Cloud Connector Fargate task to take the new rules into consideration. Again you can do so using the AWS web dashboard, or executing these commands:

```
task_id=$(aws ecs list-tasks --cluster CloudConnector --output json | jq '.taskArns[0]' | /usr/bin/xargs | sed -E 's/.*\/(.+)/\1/')
echo $task_id
AWS_PAGER="" aws ecs stop-task --cluster CloudConnector --task $task_id
```

     It usually takes the Fargate task a couple of minutes to restart. You can follow Cloud Connector logs to check it's status using this command:

```
aws logs tail cloud-connector --follow  --filter-pattern "{ $.component != http-server }"
```

     When you see info level messages indicating the rules have been loaded, and maybe some alerts, it means it is working.

1. Now we create a new log group on **us-west-2**

```
aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name "test_unused_region" --region="us-west-2"
```

     CloudTrail takes up to 10 minutes to provide the events. When the event is available, CloudConnector will trigger the rule and we will see a new security finding appear in AWS Security Hub.
