You can check these events without leaving the AWS console. This is how findings reported by Sysdig CloudConnector look in the AWS Security Hub:

1. Browse to [Security Hub](https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/home) and click 'Findings' on the left.

2. Click on "Delete bucket encryption" to view all the information you need to take immediate action:

3. And they appear in JSON format in AWS CloudWatch log streams.

    Browse to [CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), and click 'Log groups > cloud-connector > alerts'

Further, these events can be forwarded to the Sysdig Backend, and alerted upon as necessary in your normal channels.
