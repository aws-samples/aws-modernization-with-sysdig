If you are using an account provided at an AWS event, the account will be cleaned up automatically. There are no AWS costs for you in this case.

If you are using your own AWS account, it may incur some costs. 
To minimize cost, make sure you deprovision and delete those resources when you are finished. 
You can find the instructions for how to do that under the Cleanup section under each different module.
