Sysdig is driving the standard for cloud and container security and helping enterprises confidently run containers, Kubernetes, and cloud services. With the Sysdig platform, you can find and prioritize software vulnerabilities, detect and respond to threats, and manage cloud configurations, permissions, and compliance. 

From containers and Kubernetes running with solutions like Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Fargate, to your AWS cloud services such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and AWS Lambda, you get a single view of risk from source to run.

By providing real-time visibility at scale, Sysdig helps you address risk and eliminate security blind spots across your entire cloud and container environment. 

The following section provides an overview of the modules covered in this workshop as well as guidance on expected costs if you run the workshop in your own AWS account.
