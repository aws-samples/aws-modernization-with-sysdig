# Workshop Overview

 You must maintain a high level of security & compliance in your entire application environment - not doing so can result in your system becoming compromised. This can incur significant costs and can lead to commercial & business issues, and failed compliance tests leading to a loss of trust with customers, monetary fines, and/or settlement fees.  

 In a cloud native environment, the security & compliance posture of your application is dependent largely upon the security of your containers, but not exclusively - it also depends upon the infrastructure upon which it runs.

 <!-- Sysdig Secure embeds security and compliance into the build, run and respond stages of the Kubernetes lifecycle. Manage cloud security risk by integrating image scanning, threat prevention, detection and incident response into your secure DevOps workflow. -->

 <!-- In this workshop, you will learn how [[image scanning](https://sysdig.com/products/kubernetes-security/image-scanning/)](https://sysdig.com/products/kubernetes-security/image-scanning/) can provide the security insights you need without affecting the level of flexibility you desire. -->

In this workshop, you will learn how Sysdig Secure for cloud gives you **a unified Cloud Security Platform** that provides you with a complete suite for _Asset Discovery, Cloud Security Posture Management and Compliance, Vulnerability Scanning_ and _Threat Detection_ for all your cloud accounts.

In this workshop, we will guide you through the following specific Sysdig Secure for cloud integrations provided for Amazon Web Services

  - Amazon ECR Image Registry Scanning- [Workshop Overview](#workshop-overview)
    - [Expected Duration:](#expected-duration)
  - Amazon ECS & Fargate Image Scanning
  - Cloud Security Posture Management and Compliance
  - Threat Detection based on CloudTrail

For a detailed description of these Sysdig Secure for cloudSysdig Secure for cloud integrations, please refer to the [Sysdig Secure for cloud documentation](https://cloudsec.sysdig.com/aws/).

<!-- In particular, we'll guide you on how to implement **ECS Fargate image scanning** with Sysdig Secure. The resulting solution will automatically scan any container image instance that is executed, and will warn you with reports about any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in your workload. It will do this **without leaving your AWS workflow**, and without data leaving your AWS infrastructure.

 We will also look at how to use Falco to perform 'runtime' security and compliance in the context of your AWS environment using Sysdig's CloudConnector's integration with AWS CloudTrail. -->
