# Sysdig Secure for Cloud  

No matter if you are already a *cloud-native DevOps* engineer
or you are deploying your first workloads in the cloud, 
the security of your application and the cloud infrastructure where it runs
is one of the key aspects you are going to consider sooner or later.

This workshop includes a holistic overview to security.
It provides a lot of key concepts, insights and real practice
in different stages of the development pipeline.

Although this workshop approaches security from a Sysdig-*centric* perspective,
the concepts and practice included are useful for anybody:
from enterprise security engineers familiar with the platform
to all of those who are new to Sysdig but are concerned about security.


## Modules

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn about key security concepts 
and how to use *Sysdig Secure* for Cloud, to run cloud applications in production securely.

Here you can find a [detailed table with all of the contents](/0-introduction/2-modules.html).

This includes the next modules (and estimated time):

- Installation
- Vulnerability Management (*Image Scanning*)
  - Container registry scanning for ECR
  - Image scanning for Fargate on ECS
- Security Posture
- Threat Detection
  - *CloudTrail* event Threat Detection
  - *EKS* Runtime Threat Detection
  - *Fargate* Runtime Threat Detection


### Before taking the workshop

The first module (less than 5 minutes to complete!) will guide you through the installation steps.
It is a requirement for all of the modules except the *Runtime Threat Detection in Fargate*.

Every module can be taken as an independent course.

The prerequisites section is going to explain 
how to configure a Cloud9 instance (virtual terminal to access AWS resources)
through the rest of the workshop.
