# Fargate & ECS Automated Image Scanning

## Overview

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service.

AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with Amazon ECS. Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications by removing the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.

In this lab we will:

1. Install Amazon ECS CLI
1. Deploy an ECS cluster using Fargate
1. See that CodeBuild pipelines are automatically created to scan ECS deployed images
1. See scan results on Sysdig Secure dashboard


But, before you start with the content, some theory about this tools:

- [**Amazon Elastic Container Service**](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs) (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service based on Kubernetes, allowing developers to run applications without the need to configure the required running environment. Amazon ECS is fully integrated with the Docker container registry [**AWS ECR**](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr).
- [**AWS Fargate**](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate) is a serverless compute engine for containers that removes the need to provision and manage servers. Fargate works alongside Amazon ECS (as well as Amazon EKS) to allocate the correct amount of compute resources for your application no matter the load, hence eliminating the need to choose instance types or scale cluster capacity. You only pay for the resources required to run your containers, so there is no over-provisioning and paying for additional servers.
- **AWS Fargate** and **ECS** both allow you to deploy containerized workloads quickly. Those services are so convenient that many people leave them unattended, risking exposure to vulnerabilities inside their containers that can exfiltrate secrets, compromise business data, impact performance, and increase their AWS costs.
For example:
    - Think of some **credentials** mistakenly included in an image, later deployed on Fargate. They will be exposed to anyone with access to the image (think on the repository), or to the Fargate service.
    - Or consider a **known vulnerability**. Imagine you deploy a Fargate task to manage your API, and that it uses an old HTTP library version that ignores the setting to limit a request size. That could be catastrophic! Say you expect requests no bigger than 1MB, but a malicious actor exploits this vulnerability to send requests as big as 80GB. This will absolutely take a toll in your AWS bill, and might cause your service to throttle.

In this workshop you will see how Sysdig helps circumvent these threats by automating the scanning of images in ECS/Fargate, for known vulnerabilities and issues.
