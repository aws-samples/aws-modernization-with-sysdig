Now that a sample image has been deployed, the scanner should pick this up and scan it automatically.

If you wish, you can check the CodeBuild pipeline status by visiting: [Developer Tools > CodeBuild](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects?region=us-east-1). Click on the 'Sysdig-CloudVision-ScanningCodeBuildStack-*' build project, then click the build to drill down and tail the logs as the scan proceeds

1. Now go to [CodeBuild > Build projects](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects) and see the task progress.
