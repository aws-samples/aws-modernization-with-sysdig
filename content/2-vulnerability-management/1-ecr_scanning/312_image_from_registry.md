### Download Example Dockerfile and Sources

Now that our automated scanner is in place, it will trigger full registry scans every so often. 


1. Lets trigger a manual scan (we don't want to wait until the cron job triggers the next scan). Launch a job instance using kubectl.

```
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/registry-scanner registry-scanner-manual
```

The job should create a pod in the default namespace to retrieve the list of images and scan them one by one. Logs from the pod can be checked to see if everything went fine.

```
kubectl get po  
```

Take note of the pod name, it shoul dbe something like registry-scanner-manual-string. 
Retrieve pod logs with the appropriate pod name.

```
kubectl logs registry-scanner-manual-lncqq   
```
