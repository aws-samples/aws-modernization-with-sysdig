### Download Example Dockerfile and Sources

Now that our automated scanner is in place, we can test it by pushing a Docker container, and check if it scans.

To illustrate the images scanning we will build an example Node.JS application based on the official “hello world” example described in [their website](https://nodejs.org/de/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/).

1. Go to your Cloud9 Workspace and download and uncompress example container files:
    <!-- wget https://github.com/sysdiglabs/hello-world-node-vulnerable/releases/download/v1.0/hello-world-node-vulnerable.zip -->
    ```
    wget https://github.com/johnfitzpatrick/hello-world-node-vulnerable/archive/v1.2.zip
    unzip v1.2.zip
    cd hello-world-node-vulnerable-1.2 
    ```

2. And build and push the image to ECR
    ```
    AWS_ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity | jq '.Account' | xargs)
    export ECR_NAME=aws-workshop
    export REGION=us-east-1
    export IMAGE=$AWS_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/$ECR_NAME
    docker build . -t $IMAGE
    docker push $IMAGE 
    ```

3. For every new event of an image pushed to the registry, Sysdig executes an image scan using the integrated Sysdig Inline Scanner.

4. Wait a few seconds to access the scan results in Sysdig Secure. Meanwhile, you can check the logs of the scanning process in AWS by visiting: [CloudWatch > Log groups](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/sfc-cloudconnector20230104145821963400000001/log-events/ecs$252FCloudConnector$252F4a1e23420bc5463ca53cf5c0dfec008f$3FfilterPattern$3Dscan).

    There, click on: 
    - **Log group**: *sfc-cloudconnector...* 
    - **Log stream**: *ecs/CloudConnector/...* 

    Once all the logs are presented, filter by `scan` and observe the events signaling the status of the scan.

This is not the main method to observe scan results,
but an advanced tip to learn more about the process status.

### See Scan Results on Sysdig Secure Dashboard

To see the scan results on Sysdig Secure Dashboard,

1. Log into the Sysdig Secure UI, and browse to [**Vulnerabilities > Registry**](https://app.au1.sysdig.com/secure/#/vulnerabilities/registry/):

	![Sysdig Secure](/images/30_module_1/Sysdig_Secure02.png)

2. Click your new `aws-workshop` image.

	You'll see the image have several major vulnerabilities.

	![Sysdig Secure](/images/30_module_1/securescann02.png)

With Sysdig Secure you have full visibility of the security and compliance posture across your entire estate, in a single pane of glass, and as a central location for all security profiles and policies.


### ECR Scanner: *event-based* vs *full-scan*

Sysdig provides multiple methods to adjust to your use case.

The steps described above will scan images for every new push event to an ECR registry.

It is also possible to deploy and schedule the scanner to scan the registry with a cronjob.

To learn more about this method, visit the [chart documentation for the Registry Scanner](https://charts.sysdig.com/charts/registry-scanner/).


{{% notice info %}}
This method will be the main approach for ECR image scanning when the feature gets to GA.

### Digging deeper

The *sysdig-cli-scanner* is a binary that you can integrate in multiple stages of your build pipeline
You can even execute it locally to run a quick scan of an image you just built.
Let's see how to do this:

1. In your terminal, set two environmental variables with your Sysdig account API credentials:

    ```bash
    export SECURE_API_TOKEN=b7788d43-f4k3-f4k3-f4k3-d0c0edfb526e
    export SYSDIG_SECURE_ENDPOINT=https://app.au1.sysdig.com/secure/
    ```

2. Download the *sysdig-cli-scanner* and give exec permissions to it. Execute an scan with:
 
    ```bash
    curl -LO "https://download.sysdig.com/scanning/bin/sysdig-cli-scanner/$(curl -L -s https://download.sysdig.com/scanning/sysdig-cli-scanner/latest_version.txt)/linux/amd64/sysdig-cli-scanner"
    chmod +x ./sysdig-cli-scanner
    ./sysdig-cli-scanner --apiurl $SYSDIG_SECURE_ENDPOINT $IMAGE
    ```

3. The logs will provide an overview of the process:

<!-- #### Optional: Further Information

You can see a complete log of the scan process by clicking [ECS Scan log](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/johnfitzpatrick/369c1f9df765be68ba2d83cbe37f6eb3/raw/421fe8d829ad74cd406d09ca6625283e4020751b/gistfile1.txt).  This shows
