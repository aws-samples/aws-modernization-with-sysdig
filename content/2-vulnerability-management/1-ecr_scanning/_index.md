# ECR Automated Image Scanning

## Overview

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy container images. It hosts your container images in a highly available and scalable architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy containers for your applications.


## Setup the Amazon ECR Registry

For the purposes of this lab you need to an Amazon ECR registry.
A registry named `aws-workshop` in region `us-east-1` was created 
in the prerequisites section.

You can view it [Amazon UI > Repositories](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories?region=us-east-1):

The Cloud9 terminal has also been authenticated against the registry.
At this point the execution of a `docker push` will automatically
upload local images to the new registry.

In the next step, you will deploy Sysdig automated ECR scanner and build, push and scan an image from the registry (and will review the scan results on Sysdig Secure dashboard).
