# ECR Automated Image Scanning

## Overview

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy container images. It hosts your container images in a highly available and scalable architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy containers for your applications.


## Setup the Amazon ECR Registry

For the purposes of this lab you need to an Amazon ECR registry.
A registry named `aws-workshop` in region `us-east-1` was created 
in the prerequisites section.

You can view it [Amazon UI > Repositories](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories?region=us-east-1):

The Cloud9 terminal has also been authenticated against the registry.
At this point the execution of a `docker push` will automatically
upload local images to the new registry.

In the next step, you will
build, push and scan an image from the registry
and will review the scan results on Sysdig Secure dashboard

<!-- ## ECR Automated Image Scanning Reference Architecture

Once Amazon ECR Image Scanning is deployed (via the Sysdig Secure for cloud CloudFormation template), all images that are pushed to the registry will be automatically scanned within your AWS account.

How this is implemented is illustrated below.

![Reference Architecture](/images/30_module_1/arch.png)

Once a new image is pushed to Amazon ECR, this is picked up by Amazon EventBridge and passed to a Lambda function which creates an ephemeral CodeBuild task to build and scan the base image.  The results of the scan are then sent to the Sysdig Secure backend.  You are not required to configure, or expose, the registry on the Sysdig Secure side. Also, the image itself is not sent to Sysdig, but only the image metadata.

An important point to note is that, although the scan actually happens with this AWS pipeline, you maintain the scanning policies and view results within Sysdig.

#### About AWS CodeBuild -->
<!-- [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) is a fully managed continuous integration service. CodeBuild compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployable software packages without the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. -->

<!-- The ephemeral task that is created for scanning our images is important to note because AWS CodeBuild allows you to do two important steps as part of the image build process:

1. AWS CodeBuild lets you use custom containers or choose standard images provided by AWS which in this case is used to scan our container images
2. AWS CodeBuild builds the base image for your container as we need an ephemeral container that is responsible for scanning the image built for security vulnerabilities. -->

<!-- CodeBuild creates ephemeral tasks for scanning our images for security vulnerabilities as part of the image build process. It lets you use custom containers or choose standard images provided by AWS.  

The Sysdig Secure for cloud deployment will create a new **Amazon CloudBuild** project that will automatically scan container images pushed to ECR registries. -->

### Fargate & ECS Automated Image Scanning

Amazon Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). It allocates the correct amount of compute resources, eliminating the need to choose instance types and scaling cluster capacity. With Fargate, you pay for the minimum resources required to run your containers.  Sysdig provides the ability to scan running Fargate services for known issues, in a similar manner to how it scans Amazon ECR.

Any **deploy command** directed at ECS Fargate will trigger an **image scanning** event. In particular the deploy command is detected by Amazon EventBridge, which will trigger a CodeBuild pipeline via an AWS Lambda function. It is within this CodeBuild pipeline that the image scanning runs. This is very similar workflow to how we seen earlier with Amazon ECR scanning.

![Reference Architecture](/images/40_module_2/image2.png "image_tooltip")

The Sysdig inline image scanner will inspect the image to be deployed and will send its metadata to the Sysdig backend. The actual image contents won't leave the CodeBuild pipeline.

![alt_text](/images/40_module_2/image13.png "image_tooltip")

The Sysdig backend then **evaluates** the container metadata against your security policies. It will generate a **scan report** if the image doesn't pass your security requirements, so you can **take action**.
 -->

<!-- Although containers may be ingested into another system in order to be scanned, for example a Sysdig Secure backend, it's considered best practice to scan the image 'inline', i.e. locally in its current location.    -->

<!-- With inline scanning, the contents of your containers will never leave your infrastructure. This protects your privacy and prevents credentials for repositories from leaking. It may also be a requirement when security concerns require an air-gapped environment. -->

<!-- Further, from an architectural standpoint, it is more scalable to have images scanned at the edge rather than sent to a central location.   -->
