# Module 2: Vulnerability Scanning

Sysdig Secure provides a comprehensive suite of tools to enhance and compliance across your application's ecosystem.
One critical part of **CNAPP** / **CWPP** platforms is vulnerability management. This kind of tools are meant to scan the images that belong to your application workloads so that you can deploy and run them confidently.

Sysdig Secure supports scanning of images at multiple points along the software development lifecycle. In relation to services running on AWS, there are several approaches to automated image vulnerability scanning:

 - Pipeline
   - CICD tools (Jenkins, GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, etc.)
   - EKS Admission-controller Image Scanning
 - Runtime
   - Continuous scan of EKS runtime container images
 - Registry
   - ECR Automated Image Scanning
   - Any other v2 Registry like JFro

An image scanner inspects a container's content to **detect potential threats** such as unencrypted passwords, known vulnerabilities, exposed ports, etc.
You can implement [scanning best practices](https://sysdig.com/blog/image-scanning-best-practices/) on several phases of your **DevOps pipeline**, blocking threats before they are deployed into production, and without adding extra overhead.
It you want to learn more about about this process, visit the [Vulnerablity Management](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/vulnerabilities) document.

Sysdig Secure manages every aspect of the container scan. With Sysdig you can define **image scanning policies** to validate a container's content against **vulnerability databases**, and search for **misconfigurations** like running as a privileged user, unnecessary open ports, or leaked credentials.

## In-Use prioritization powered by Runtime Insights

Every application is built with a determined number of libraries and dependencies but only a subset of them is loaded at runtime. Knowing what are loaded is a powerful prioritization advantage.

Sysdig EKS container scanning provides a special prioritization context called "In-Use" powered by Sysdig Runtime Insights which reduce noise by flagging what container packages are loaded (Sysdig agents analyze the behaviour of EKS workloads under execution).

Up to 95% of vulnerabilities can be filtered using "In-Use" flag. When combined with other flags like "Exploit", this prioritization approach can reduce the noise dramatically, saving time and resources to prioritize what matters.

Runtime Insights "In Use" algorithm bootstrap process require some hours when a new cluster is onboarded, so it will not be possible to show this feature in action during this workshop. Feel free to use a 30-day Free Trial to test it by yourself with your own EKS cluster.

## Image Scanning Policies

Not only can you create multiple policies that determine what the scan is looking for, but also _where_ to implement it. For example, in your CI/CD pipeline you may wish to use the test site **https://sandbox.payment-engine.com/** during your automated QA tests, but when building containers for production this must be the live **https://live.payment-engine.com**. Or, you may wish to scan specifically for PSI or NIST compliance in a production site.

Further, you may wish to scan existing running containers for **zero day** vulnerabilities that have recently been detected.

In either case, the output of the scan will be sent back to Sysdig from where you can browse the results or run reports.
