# Module 2: Vulnerability Management

Sysdig Secure provides a comprehensive suite of tools to enhance security and compliance across your application ecosystem. One critical part of CNAPP / CWPP platforms is vulnerability management. 
Vulnerability management tools scan hosts and container images to identify common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) across OS packages and third-party libraries, as well as identify misconfigurations and other bad security practices. This gives you the information you need to understand and address risk before running workloads in production.
Sysdig Secure supports image scanning at multiple points along the software development lifecycle. In relation to services running on AWS, there are several approaches to automated image vulnerability scanning:

 - Pipeline
   - Image scanning within CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, GitLab)
   - Amazon EKS admission-controller image scanning
 - Runtime
   - Continuous scanning of Amazon EKS runtime container images
 - Registry
   - Amazon ECR automated image scanning
   - Image scanning with Docker v2 registries like JFrog Artifactory
 - Developer workstation with a sysdig-cli-scanner

In all cases, the contents of your containers will never leave your infrastructure. This protects your privacy and prevents credentials for repositories from leaking. It may also be a requirement when security concerns require an air-gapped environment.


![Image Scanning](/images/00_introduction/image_scanning01.png)

An image scanner inspects a container's content to **detect potential threats** such as unencrypted passwords, known vulnerabilities, exposed ports, etc.
You can implement [scanning best practices](https://sysdig.com/blog/image-scanning-best-practices/) on several phases of your **DevOps pipeline**, blocking threats before they are deployed into production, and without adding extra overhead.
It you want to learn more about about this process, visit the [Vulnerablity Management](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/vulnerabilities) document.

Sysdig Secure manages every aspect of the container scan. With Sysdig you can define **image scanning policies** to validate a container's content against **vulnerability databases**, and search for **misconfigurations** like running as a privileged user, unnecessary open ports, or leaked credentials.


## Image Scanning Policies

Not only can you create multiple policies that determine what the scan is looking for, but also _where_ to implement it. For example, in your CI/CD pipeline you may wish to use the test site **https://sandbox.payment-engine.com/** during your automated QA tests, but when building containers for production this must be the live **https://live.payment-engine.com**. Or, you may wish to scan specifically for PSI or NIST compliance in a production site.

Further, you may wish to scan existing running containers for **zero day** vulnerabilities that have recently been detected.


## Image Scanning Reporting

In either case, the output of the scan will be sent back to Sysdig from where you can browse the results or run reports.
