# Module 2: Vulnerability Scanning

Sysdig Secure provides a comprehensive suite of tools to enhance and compliance across your application's ecosystem.
One critical part of **CWPP** platforms is vulnerability management. This kind of tools are meant to scan the images that belong to your application workloads so that you can deploy and run them confidently.

<!-- Sysdigâ€™s **ImageVision** technology identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations by automating scanning within CI/CD pipelines and registries, as well as implementing registry scanning inline. It also blocks vulnerabilities pre-production, monitors for new CVEs at runtime, and helps you map a critical vulnerability back to an application and dev team. -->

Sysdig Secure supports scanning of images at multiple points along the software development lifecycle. In relation to services running on AWS, there are several approaches to automated image vulnerability scanning:

 - Pipeline
   - EKS Runtime Image Scanning
   - [AWS CodeBuild scanning](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/secure-inline-scan-examples/blob/main/aws-codebuild/new-scan-engine/build.yaml)
   - Jenkins
   - EKS Admission-controller Image Scanning
 - Runtime
   - Sysdig Node Image Analyzer for EKS and/or ECS
 - Registry
   - ECR Automated Image Scanning
   - JFrog

In all cases, the contents of your containers will never leave your infrastructure. This protects your privacy and prevents credentials for repositories from leaking. It may also be a requirement when security concerns require an air-gapped environment.

An image scanner inspects a container's content to **detect potential threats** such as unencrypted passwords, known vulnerabilities, exposed ports, etc.
You can implement [scanning best practices](https://sysdig.com/blog/image-scanning-best-practices/) on several phases of your **DevOps pipeline**, blocking threats before they are deployed into production, and without adding extra overhead.
It you want to learn more about about this process, visit the [Digging Deeper section](/2-vulnerability-management/9-digdeeper.html).

Sysdig Secure manages every aspect of the container scan. With Sysdig you can define **image scanning policies** to validate a container's content against **vulnerability databases**, and search for **misconfigurations** like running as a privileged user, unnecessary open ports, or leaked credentials.


## Image Scanning Policies

Not only can you create multiple policies that determine what the scan is looking for, but also _where_ to implement it. For example, in your CI/CD pipeline you may wish to use the test site **https://sandbox.payment-engine.com/** during your automated QA tests, but when building containers for production this must be the live **https://live.payment-engine.com**. Or, you may wish to scan specifically for PSI or NIST compliance in a production site.

Further, you may wish to scan existing running containers for **zero day** vulnerabilities that have recently been detected.

In either case, the output of the scan will be sent back to Sysdig from where you can browse the results or run reports.
