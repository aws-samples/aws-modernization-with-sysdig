## Module 3 Prework: Setup CloudTrail Runtime Security

We will be looking at CloudTrail runtime security in module 3 of this workshop. However, the CloudFormation template required can take up to ten minutes to deploy.  So, we will start the deployment now, and it should be complete later when we need it.

There are two steps required to enable CloudTrail runtime security:

1. Firstly, you must enable AWS Security Hub in the account, then
2. Deploy the Sysdig CloudConnector CloudFormation template.
