To deploy the Sysdig image scanner for Fargate, we'll again use Amazon CloudFormation.  The procedure is identical to how we installed Amazon ECR Integration in the previous lab, so this time we'll use the AWS CLI instead.

***Note*** You can find instructions on using the CLI on the [[Sysdig Fargate scanning installation page](https://sysdiglabs.github.io/ecs-image-scanning/install.html)](https://sysdiglabs.github.io/ecs-image-scanning/install.html)

<!--
1. Copy and run the following two commands into your Cloud9 Workspace console and follow the instructions to configure your __Secure API Token__ and  __Secure API Endpoint__ as environment variables.

```sh
echo "Enter your 'Sysdig Secure API Token' from above"; read SecureAPITokenâ€©
```

```sh
echo "Enter your 'Sysdig Secure API Endpoint' from above"; read SecureEndpoint
```
 -->


 1. Configure your __Secure API Token__ and  __Secure API Endpoint__ as environment variables.

 ```sh
 SecureAPIToken=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>
 ```

 ```sh
 SecureEndpoint=<YOUR_API_ENDPOINT>
 ```

    You should have made a note of these environment variables when setting up your [Sysdig Trial Account](10_prerequisites/12_sysdig.md). 

    Make sure your Sysdig `SecureAPIToken` and `SecureEndpoint` environment variables are set correctly.

    ```
    echo $SecureAPIToken
    echo $SecureEndpoint
    ```

1. Let's set our CloudFormation template URL as an environment variable to simplify the actual `aws` command.  

    ```
    CFURI="https://cf-templates-secure-scanning-ecs.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-image-scanning.template"
    ```

2. Then run the the following AWS CloudFormation command (which uses those environment parameters)

    ```
    aws cloudformation create-stack \
    --stack-name ECSImageScanning \
    --template-body $CFURI \
    --parameters ParameterKey=ECSInlineSecureAPIToken,ParameterValue=$SecureAPIToken  ParameterKey=ECSInlineSecureEndpoint,ParameterValue=$SecureEndpoint ParameterKey=ECSInlineScanningType,ParameterValue=Inline \
    --capabilities "CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM"
    ```

You can check the status of the CloudFormation task by browsing to the [CloudFormation UI](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)

Wait until the CloudFormation task completes, which may take several minutes.

Once all stacks are created, you will be ready to deploy our ECS tasks in a Fargate cluster securely, as all images will be scanned automatically.  In the next steps we will see this scanning as it happens.
