In this module we saw how to use Sysdig's AWS ECR integration to automatically scan images upon being added to Amazon ECR.

In particular we looked at how to deploy the Amazon ECR Integration using AWS CloudFormation template. Then we saw how to setup the Amazon ECR Registry and push images to the it and observe them being scanned.

Finally we looked at how to view the scan results on the Sysdig Secure dashboard.

In the next module we will look at how to scan images automatically in AWS ECS and Fargate.
