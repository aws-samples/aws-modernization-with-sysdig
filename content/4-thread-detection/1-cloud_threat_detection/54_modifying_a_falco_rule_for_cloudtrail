**Updating Falco rules can take 20mins to filter through, so removing this from the workshop**
**Keeping it here as we can still use the steps in a video script**

Using Sysdig CloudConnector, you are not limited to the out-of-the-box rules provided. You can modify existing rules, or write your own tailored to your own needs.

So, letâ€™s try first modifying a rule. The rule **AWS command executed on unused region** checks if a resource is created in a region that you are not permitted to use - the prohibited regions are specified in Falco list called **disallowed_aws_regions**.

  ![Sysdig Events](/images/falco_02.png)

<!--
```
- list: disallowed_aws_regions
  items: []

- rule: AWS command executed on unused region
  desc: Detect AWS command execution on unused regions
  condition: >
    not jevt.value[/errorCode] exists and
    jevt.value[/awsRegion] in (disallowed_aws_regions)
  output: >
    An AWS command has been executed on an unused region
    (requesting user=%jevt.value[/userIdentity/arn],
     requesting IP=%jevt.value[/sourceIPAddress],
     AWS region=%jevt.value[/awsRegion]
  priority: CRITICAL
  tags: [cloud, source=cloudtrail, aws]
  source: k8s_audit
``` -->

Lets assume for the purposes of this lab that you are not permitted to use AWS regions **us-west-1** or **us-west-2**.

<!--
For the *disallowed_aws_regions* empty list that is included, so we are going to extend it to include **us-west-1** and **us-west-2**. Let's update that list to add those regions.

```
  - list: disallowed_aws_regions
    items: [us-west-1, us-west-2]
    append: true

``` -->


<!-- 1. To create a `disallowed_aws_regions.yaml` file in a `rules` directory, you can run the following -->

1. Navigate to 'Policies > Falco Lists'

1. Click on **disallowed_aws_regions**, then **Edit**

1. Add '**us-west-1, us-west-2**'

    ![Sysdig Events](/images/falco_05.png)

1. Click **Save** then **Done**

    The rules and policies are read from Sysdig Secure every 5 minutes.

    Now let's create another S3 bucket, but specify the prohibited region **us-west-2** and watch it trigger a security alert.

1. Check your initials are set in the environment variable `INITIALS` from before (these should already be set)

    ```
    echo $INITIALS
    ```

    If not you can run `INITIALS=<your initials>` as before

1. Now create the new S3 bucket, but this time in **us-west-1** (the `date` command will ensure the bucket name is different to previous one).

    ```
    NEWBUCKETNAME="${INITIALS,,}"-$(date +%s)
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket $NEWBUCKETNAME --acl public-read --region us-west-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-1
    ```

    CloudTrail takes up to several minutes to provide the events. When the event is available, the rule will be triggered and we will see a new security event in Sysdig Secure.
