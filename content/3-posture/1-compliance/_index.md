## What is Compliance?

Compliance is the set of practices aimed at meeting a set of regulatory industry requirements, best practices and rules.

All industries have regulations to meet and software is not an exception.
In Software Security, there are different benchmarks to guarantee robust controls
of cloud assets and Kubernetes workloads (SOC, ISO, etc.).

To operate in some bussiness areas, it is required to be acredited to one or more of them.

How can you know what's your current compliance status?
Manually evaluating compliance requirements is an impossible task.
This is why a tool like Sysdig Secure can help your organization to stay compliant.

Sysdig Secure will check the status of your organization regarding different compliance benchmarks
and suggest and apply remediation to those not meeting the standard.
