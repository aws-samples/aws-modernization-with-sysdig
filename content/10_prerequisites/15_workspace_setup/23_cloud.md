{{% notice info %}}
Cloud9 normally manages IAM credentials dynamically. This isn't currently compatible with
the EKS IAM authentication, so we will disable it and rely on the IAM role instead.

  1. Return to your workspace and click the gear icon (in top right corner), or click to open a new tab and choose "Open Preferences"

  2. Select **AWS SETTINGS** and turn off **AWS managed temporary credentials**

  3. Close the Preferences tab

export AWS_REGION=$(curl -s 169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | jq -r '.region')
test -n "$AWS_REGION" && echo AWS_REGION is "$AWS_REGION" || echo AWS_REGION is not set

# Configure .bash_profile
export ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --output text --query Account)
echo "export ACCOUNT_ID=${ACCOUNT_ID}" | tee -a ~/.bash_profile
echo "export AWS_REGION=${AWS_REGION}" |
tee -a ~/.bash_profile
aws configure set default.region ${AWS_REGION}
aws configure get default.region
