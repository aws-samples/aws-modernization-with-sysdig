[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that Let’s you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don’t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.

We will use Amazon Cloud9 to access our AWS account via the AWS CLI in this Workshop.  There are a few steps to complete to set this up

- Create a new Cloud9 IDE environment
- Create an IAM role for your workspace
- Attach the IAM role to your Workspace
- Configure workshop specific requirements
