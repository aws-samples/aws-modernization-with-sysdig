# Access an AWS account
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[attending an AWS hosted event](13_aws_event.html), or
* ...[running the workshop on your own](14_self_paced.html)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**launching a Cloud9 IDE Workspace**](/10_prerequisites/16_start_cloud9workspace.html)
