# Workshop Prerequisites

There are a few prerequisite tasks you must perform before getting started on this workshop.  These are:

1. Access an AWS account
2. Launch Cloud9 IDE Workspace
<!-- 3. Sign-up for a Sysdig Trial account -->

We will step through each of these in turn.

## Access an AWS account
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* [Attending an AWS hosted event]({{< ref "/10_prerequisites/14_aws_event_setup.md" >}}), or
* [Running the workshop on your own]({{< ref "/10_prerequisites/16_aws_setup_your_own.md" >}})

<!-- * [Attending an AWS hosted event](/10_prerequisites/14_aws_event_setup.html), or
* [Running the workshop on your own](/10_prerequisites/16_aws_setup_your_own.html) -->

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Launch a Cloud9 IDE Workspace**]({{< ref "/10_prerequisites/18_start_cloud9workspace.md" >}})
